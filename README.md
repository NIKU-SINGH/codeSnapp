## üíº About the Project


## ü§î Problem Statement

Develop a GitHub App that provides users with the output of code when they create pull requests on GitHub repositories. The app should be designed to listen for pull request creation events, execute code in response to specific commands in comments or commit messages, and capture and display the output. The app should enhance the GitHub experience by offering innovative and useful functionalities.

## Requirement

- GitHub Integration: Create a GitHub App that seamlessly integrates with all GitHub repositories.

- Event Listening: Configure the app to listen for pull request creation events.

- Code Execution: Implement the functionality to execute code when a pull request contains the specific command ("/execute") in a comment or commit message.

- Output Capture: Capture the output of the executed code and post it as a response to the pull request or as a comment.

- Security and Best Practices: Ensure the app is secure, adheres to GitHub's best practices, and handles authentication appropriately.

- Documentation: Provide clear and concise documentation on how to set up and use the GitHub App.

- Innovation and Use Cases: The app should offer innovative and valuable use cases that enhance the user's experience while working on GitHub repositories. These use cases should address various aspects of code management, collaboration, and automation.

This GitHub App should improve code collaboration, automate code execution, and provide insights, thereby making it a valuable asset for GitHub users.
